# Simple Tools and Useful Functions (STUF)
Doing some simple things with spatial transcriptomics data with existing tools can be challening. STUF is a collection of functions that make the following and some other tasks easier: 

- transform coordinates
- define contours
- find genes with expression patterns similar to a user-provided gene
- bivariate plotting
- other custom visualizations
- manually add lines and shapes to your ST data
