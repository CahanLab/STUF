# Simple Tools and Useful Functions (STUF). a computational toolkit for the single cell analysis and comparison of embryos and embryo models
When we started analyzing spatial transcriptomics data, we found it easier to implement our own functions rwather than trying to adapt this collective functionality that was dispersed across many other packages. STUF includes:

- coordinate transformations
- contour definition
- customized visualizations
